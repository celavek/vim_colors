This is just a bundle of colorschemes for vim gathered in one location to be
used with pathogen and vim plugins git submodules setup.

Some of the schemes do not work in terminal vim or/and need to be further tweaked
to work properly.

Install with:

git submodule add https://github.com/celavek/vim_colors.git bundle/colorschemes
